# Roadmap

Cleanup everything. Find a way to cleanly invoke gulp in all instances (from installed package and locally for testing).

Hook up CI, so we can be sure we don't break things.

Cleanup all the path calculations so that we don't get bitten by '/dist/'

Possibly move the Storyformat definitions to another repo? It bloats this package. from 40kb to 1.6mb.
