# Roadmap

Hook up CI, so we can be sure we don't break things.

Cleanup all the path calculations so that we don't get bitten by '/dist/'

Possibly move the Storyformat definitions to another repo? It bloats this package. from 40kb to 1.6mb.

Fix some of the print output.

Add config options for out directory.

Split up the "gen" directory from the "dist" directory. To make it easier to deploy the games.

Combine this repo with the cruft-spindle repo and the cruft-typescript-pkg repo.
