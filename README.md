# twine-builder
WIP Project porting my opinionated twine builder to a modular system.

Reimplementing as a Gulp Task

Possible ideas for name of this project:

  - `entwine`: The verb of wrapping something in twine, meshing things together
  - `spindle`: Metal spike used to pull loose wool in to yarn or twine
